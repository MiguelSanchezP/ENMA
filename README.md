ENMA
----
ENMA is an application thought for those people who are thrilled by cryptography.
Via some really basic interface, the user may be capable of cyphering their own messages using a wide range of mehtods. It is not just limited to the typical ones. By using the application, a journey through the history of cryptography can be enjoyed, as methods go from hisotric and basic to some way more complex and actual. By the moment the application has the following ones:
- Caesar
- ROT (from ROT1 to ROT25)
- Transposition (both in horizontal and vertical option)
- Vigen√©re (with the possibility of using the message as the key - autokey)
This application also includes the decyphering method, where the algorithm is reverted in order to get the original message back. For additional security, it also comes with multiple configurations when it comes to the way of displaying the cyphered message, as for example ignoring the spaces or swaping them with the commonly used character 'X'. 

For more information about the methods and the application itself, please see the wiki.
